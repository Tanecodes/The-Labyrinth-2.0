# The-Labyrinth-2.0
Redoing the whole labyrinth project from the ground up 
as i got more into the project i realised how messed up it was and i just thought i would start fresh 
with a more cleaner way to find and fix code and a beeter way to manage things. Hopefully this time i do a better job

This project is a game to help me understand more about web development.
I'm going for a first person click style dungeon crawler with a style of D&D battle mechanics.
Pixel art style graphics using ChatGPT to generate and help me with background images and player portraits.

All the graphics will be static for now maybe in the future i might switch it up.

hopefully i do a better job this time.
wish me luck
